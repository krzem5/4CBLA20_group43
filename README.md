This repository has no documentation or commit history, as it only exists to showcase the source code of the flight path optimization program used by me during the design process of the launcher mechanism during the CBL course. Note that this repository will be deleted exactly **TWO WEEKS** after the due date of the final CBL assignment (the end of the examination period). If for any reason the access to this source code is required past the aforementioned deadline, feel free to contact me (Krzesimir Hyżyk) via email to resolve this issue.
